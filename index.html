<!-- Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula BMI=mass/height^2 (mass in Kg and height in meters).

1-For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass and height.
2-Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.
3-In the end, show in the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Dont forget they might have the same BMI.-->
